The estimated critical path is highlighted in blue, and the actual critical path is highlighted in red.

Using the technique listed in the README, we estimated that the critical path would be from a to REG_1. Using the latencies from part 2,
we specifically estimated that it would go from a to ADD_1 in 6.384 ns, from ADD_1 to COMP_1 in 6.820 ns, from COMP_1 to MUX2x1_1 in
5.361 ns, and from MUX2x1_1 to REG_1 (time not counted). This led to an estimated critical path of 6.384 ns + 6.820 ns + 5.361 ns = 18.565 ns.
Due to vivado optimizations, this path cannot be easily traced. To highlight the path in our schematic, we used Vivado to report timing
paths solely from a to REG_1 and selected the worst one.

The actual critical path was 7.464ns and went from a to REG_2. This is significantly shorter than the estimated critical path of 18.565 ns.
We believe that the IBUF/OBUF components added when synthesizing the datapath components resulted in inflated critical path estimates.

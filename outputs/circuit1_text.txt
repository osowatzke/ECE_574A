The estimated critical path is highlighted in blue, and the actual critical path is highlighted in red. The critical path of each datapath component is also
annotated in the schematic.

Using the technique listed in the README, we estimated that the critical path would be 6.384 ns + 6.820 ns + 5.361 ns = 18.565 ns. The actual
critical path was 7.646 ns.
 
The estimated critical path differed from the actual critical path because Vivado added IBUFs/OBUFs to each of our datapath components when they
were individually synthesized. This increased the critical path measurement for each component and biased the overall estimate.
